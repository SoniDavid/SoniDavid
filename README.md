Hi, I am David Soni :b
================================

<p align=left>I describe myself as a geek who, apart from computers and programming 🧑‍💻, loves reading 📖, playing guitar 🎸, photography 📸, and videogames (specially rpgs and jrpgs)🎮. Any recommendations of these are more than welcome and I'll gladly talk about hours of these topics. :p</p>
